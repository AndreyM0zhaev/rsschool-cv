### ***About me***
I started my career in IT from the position of a technical writer in one of the Minsk IT product companies. To create an accurate and understandable description of the functionality of the software, I needed to delve into all the details of the products produced. That's how I started to find bugs and inconsistencies. I was offered to work as a part-time tester, and later become a full-fledged member of the QA department team. 

I like my work, the atmosphere and involvement in something global, to see how what I'm working on gets better and benefits people. 

To improve the quality of my work, I am constantly studying something, looking for courses, resources and webinars. Thus, I took several courses on software quality assurance. At one of these courses, I liked the manner of teaching in a free style, where a community of students united and helped each other. My next goal was to develop to the SDET or developer level. So I ended up on a preparatory course at RSSchool.
